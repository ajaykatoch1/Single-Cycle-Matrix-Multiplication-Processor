# Single-Cycle-Matrix-Multiplication-Processor
In this project me and my partner created a single cycle processor in Verilog that can compute matrix multiplication on different sized matrices.
The solutions of the matrix are then displayed on an FPGA (xc7a100tcsg) in the coreesponding order using the eight digit display.
To create the project make a new Verilog project and import the files.
